# Generating Synthetic Datasets by Interpolating along Generalized Geodesics

This is the official `Python` implementation of the [UAI 2023](https://www.auai.org/uai2023/) paper **Generating Synthetic Datasets by Interpolating along Generalized Geodesics** by [Jiaojiao Fan](https://sbyebss.github.io/) and [David Alvarez-Melis](https://dmelis.github.io/).

The repository contains reproducible `PyTorch` source code for few-shot transfer learning on \*NIST and [VTAB](https://github.com/google-research/task_adaptation) datasets.
